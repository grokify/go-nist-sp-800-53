<p>When it is known that systems or system components will be in high-risk areas external to the organization, additional controls may be implemented to counter the increased threat in such areas. For example, organizations can take actions for notebook computers used by individuals departing on and returning from travel. Actions include determining the locations that are of concern, defining the required configurations for the components, ensuring that components are configured as intended before travel is initiated, and applying controls to the components after travel is completed. Specially configured notebook computers include computers with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and more stringent configuration settings. Controls applied to mobile devices upon return from travel include examining the mobile device for signs of physical tampering and purging and reimaging disk drives. Protecting information that resides on mobile devices is addressed in the <a href="#mp">MP</a> (Media Protection) family.</p>

The concept of permitting the execution of authorized software may also be applied to user actions, system ports and protocols, IP addresses/ranges, websites, and MAC addresses. Organizations consider verifying the integrity of authorized software programs using digital signatures, cryptographic checksums, or hash functions. Verification of authorized software can occur either prior to execution or at system startup.

<p>Take the following actions when unauthorized components are detected: disable network access by unauthorized components, isolate unauthorized components, and/or notify personnel or roles to be notified when unauthorized components are detected is/are defined (if selected);.</p>
<p>Automated unauthorized component detection is applied in addition to the monitoring for unauthorized remote connections and mobile devices. Monitoring for unauthorized system components may be accomplished on an ongoing basis or by the periodic scanning of systems for that purpose. Automated mechanisms may also be used to prevent the connection of unauthorized components (see <a href="#cm-7.9">CM-7(9)</a> ). Automated mechanisms can be implemented in systems or in separate system components. When acquiring and implementing automated mechanisms, organizations consider whether such mechanisms depend on the ability of the system component to support an agent or supplicant in order to be detected since some types of components do not have or cannot support agents (e.g., IoT devices, sensors).

<h3 id="cm-9-configuration-management-plan">CM-9: Configuration Management Plan</h3>
<p>Develop, document, and implement a configuration management plan for the system that:</p>
<p>Addresses roles, responsibilities, and configuration management processes and procedures;</p>
<p>Establishes a process for identifying configuration items throughout the system development life cycle and for managing the configuration of the configuration items;</p>
<p>Defines the configuration items for the system and places the configuration items under configuration management;</p>
<p>Is reviewed and approved by personnel or roles to review and approve the configuration management plan is/are defined; ; and</p>
<p>Protects the configuration management plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.</p>
<p>Configuration management activities occur throughout the system development life cycle. As such, there are developmental configuration management activities (e.g., the control of code and software libraries) and operational configuration management activities (e.g., control of installed components and how the components are configured). Configuration management plans satisfy the requirements in configuration management policies while being tailored to individual systems. Configuration management plans define processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support system development life cycle activities.</p>
<p>Configuration management plans are generated during the development and acquisition stage of the system development life cycle. The plans describe how to advance changes through change management processes; update configuration settings and baselines; maintain component inventories; control development, test, and operational environments; and develop, release, and update key documents.</p>
<p>Organizations can employ templates to help ensure the consistent and timely development and implementation of configuration management plans. Templates can represent a configuration management plan for the organization with subsets of the plan implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration management approval processes include the designation of key stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving proposed changes to systems, and personnel who conduct security and privacy impact analyses prior to the implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration items are the system components, such as the hardware, software, firmware, and documentation to be configuration-managed. As systems continue through the system development life cycle, new configuration items may be identified, and some existing configuration items may no longer need to be under configuration control.</p>

<p>Document changes to the location (i.e., system or system components) where the information is processed and stored.</p>
<p>Information location addresses the need to understand where information is being processed and stored. Information location includes identifying where specific information types and information reside in system components and how information is being processed so that information flow can be understood and adequate protection and policy management provided for such information and system components. The security category of the information is also a factor in determining the controls necessary to protect the information and the system component where the information resides (see <a href="#628d22a1-6a11-4784-bc59-5cd9497b5445">FIPS 199</a> ). The location of the information and system components is also a factor in the architecture and design of the system (see <a href="#sa-4">SA-4</a>, <a href="#sa-8">SA-8</a>, <a href="#sa-17">SA-17</a>).</p>

<p>Use automated tools to identify information to be protected is defined by information type; on system components where the information is located are defined; to ensure controls are in place to protect organizational information and individual privacy.</p>
<p>The use of automated tools helps to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the information location capability implemented within the system. Automation also helps organizations manage the data produced during information location activities and share such information across the organization. The output of automated information location tools can be used to guide and inform system architecture and design decisions.</p>
