<p>Planning policy and procedures for the controls in the PL family implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on their development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission level or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to planning policy and procedures include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.</p>

<p>Update the plans to address changes to the system and environment of operation or problems identified during plan implementation or control assessments; and</p>
<p>Protect the plans from unauthorized disclosure and modification.</p>
<p>System security and privacy plans are scoped to the system and system components within the defined authorization boundary and contain an overview of the security and privacy requirements for the system and the controls selected to satisfy the requirements. The plans describe the intended application of each selected control in the context of the system with a sufficient level of detail to correctly implement the control and to subsequently assess the effectiveness of the control. The control documentation describes how system-specific and hybrid controls are implemented and the plans and expectations regarding the functionality of the system. System security and privacy plans can also be used in the design and development of systems in support of life cycle-based security and privacy engineering processes. System security and privacy plans are living documents that are updated and adapted throughout the system development life cycle (e.g., during capability determination, analysis of alternatives, requests for proposal, and design reviews). <a href="#c3397cc9-83c6-4459-adb2-836739dc1b94">Section 2.1</a> describes the different types of requirements that are relevant to organizations during the system development life cycle and the relationship between requirements and controls.</p>
<p>Organizations may develop a single, integrated security and privacy plan or maintain separate plans. Security and privacy plans relate security and privacy requirements to a set of controls and control enhancements. The plans describe how the controls and control enhancements meet the security and privacy requirements but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the design or implementation of the controls and control enhancements. Security and privacy plans contain sufficient information (including specifications of control parameter values for selection and assignment operations explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented.</p>
<p>Security and privacy plans need not be single documents. The plans can be a collection of various documents, including documents that already exist. Effective security and privacy plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents, including design and implementation specifications where more detailed information can be obtained. The use of references helps reduce the documentation associated with security and privacy programs and maintains the security- and privacy-related information in other established management and operational areas, including enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. Security and privacy plans need not contain detailed contingency plan or incident response plan information but can instead provide—explicitly or by reference—sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished by those plans.</p>
<p>Security- and privacy-related activities that may require coordination and planning with other individuals or groups within the organization include assessments, audits, inspections, hardware and software maintenance, acquisition and supply chain risk management, patch management, and contingency plan testing. Planning and coordination include emergency and nonemergency (i.e., planned or non-urgent unplanned) situations. The process defined by organizations to plan and coordinate security- and privacy-related activities can also be included in other documents, as appropriate.</p>

<p>Rules of behavior represent a type of access agreement for organizational users. Other types of access agreements include nondisclosure agreements, conflict-of-interest agreements, and acceptable use agreements (see <a href="#ps-6">PS-6</a> ). Organizations consider rules of behavior based on individual user roles and responsibilities and differentiate between rules that apply to privileged users and rules that apply to general users. Establishing rules of behavior for some types of non-organizational users, including individuals who receive information from federal systems, is often not feasible given the large number of such users and the limited nature of their interactions with the systems. Rules of behavior for organizational and non-organizational users can also be established in <a href="#ac-8">AC-8</a> . The related controls section provides a list of controls that are relevant to organizational rules of behavior. <a href="#pl-4_smt.b">PL-4b</a> , the documented acknowledgment portion of the control, may be satisfied by the literacy training and awareness and role-based training programs conducted by organizations if such training includes rules of behavior.

<h3 id="pl-10-baseline-selection">PL-10: Baseline Selection</h3>
<p>Select a control baseline for the system.</p>
<p>Control baselines are predefined sets of controls specifically assembled to address the protection needs of a group, organization, or community of interest. Controls are chosen for baselines to either satisfy mandates imposed by laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines or address threats common to all users of the baseline under the assumptions specific to the baseline. Baselines represent a starting point for the protection of individuals’ privacy, information, and information systems with subsequent tailoring actions to manage risk in accordance with mission, business, or other constraints (see <a href="#pl-11">PL-11</a> ). Federal control baselines are provided in <a href="#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752">SP 800-53B</a> . The selection of a control baseline is determined by the needs of stakeholders. Stakeholder needs consider mission and business requirements as well as mandates imposed by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. For example, the control baselines in <a href="#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752">SP 800-53B</a> are based on the requirements from <a href="#0c67b2a9-bede-43d2-b86d-5f35b8be36e9">FISMA</a> and <a href="#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455">PRIVACT</a> . The requirements, along with the NIST standards and guidelines implementing the legislation, direct organizations to select one of the control baselines after the reviewing the information types and the information that is processed, stored, and transmitted on the system; analyzing the potential adverse impact of the loss or compromise of the information or system on the organization’s operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation; and considering the results from system and organizational risk assessments. <a href="#4e4fbc93-333d-45e6-a875-de36b878b6b9">CNSSI 1253</a> provides guidance on control baselines for national security systems.</p>

<h3 id="pl-11-baseline-tailoring">PL-11: Baseline Tailoring</h3>
<p>Tailor the selected control baseline by applying specified tailoring actions.</p>
<p>The concept of tailoring allows organizations to specialize or customize a set of baseline controls by applying a defined set of tailoring actions. Tailoring actions facilitate such specialization and customization by allowing organizations to develop security and privacy plans that reflect their specific mission and business functions, the environments where their systems operate, the threats and vulnerabilities that can affect their systems, and any other conditions or situations that can impact their mission or business success. Tailoring guidance is provided in <a href="#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752">SP 800-53B</a> . Tailoring a control baseline is accomplished by identifying and designating common controls, applying scoping considerations, selecting compensating controls, assigning values to control parameters, supplementing the control baseline with additional controls as needed, and providing information for control implementation. The general tailoring actions in <a href="#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752">SP 800-53B</a> can be supplemented with additional actions based on the needs of organizations. Tailoring actions can be applied to the baselines in <a href="#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752">SP 800-53B</a> in accordance with the security and privacy requirements from <a href="#0c67b2a9-bede-43d2-b86d-5f35b8be36e9">FISMA</a>, <a href="#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455">PRIVACT</a> , and <a href="#27847491-5ce1-4f6a-a1e4-9e483782f0ef">OMB A-130</a> .
