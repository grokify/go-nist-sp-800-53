<p>Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and</p>

<p>Procedures the frequency at which the current awareness and training procedures are reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require procedures to be reviewed and updated are defined;.</p>
<p>Awareness and training policy and procedures address the controls in the AT family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of awareness and training policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to awareness and training policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.</p>

<h3 id="at-2-literacy-training-and-awareness">AT-2: Literacy Training and Awareness</h3>
<p>Provide security and privacy literacy training to system users (including managers, senior executives, and contractors):</p>
<p>As part of initial training for new users and organization-defined frequency thereafter; and</p>
<p>When required by system changes or following organization-defined events;</p>
<p>Employ the following techniques to increase the security and privacy awareness of system users techniques to be employed to increase the security and privacy awareness of system users are defined;;</p>
<p>Update literacy training and awareness content the frequency at which to update literacy training and awareness content is defined; and following events that would require literacy training and awareness content to be updated are defined; ; and</p>
<p>Incorporate lessons learned from internal or external security incidents or breaches into literacy training and awareness techniques.</p>
<p>Organizations provide basic and advanced levels of literacy training to system users, including measures to test the knowledge level of users. Organizations determine the content of literacy training and awareness based on specific organizational requirements, the systems to which personnel have authorized access, and work environments (e.g., telework). The content includes an understanding of the need for security and privacy as well as actions by users to maintain security and personal privacy and to respond to suspected incidents. The content addresses the need for operations security and the handling of personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Awareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security and privacy reminders, displaying logon screen messages, generating email advisories or notices from organizational officials, and conducting awareness events. Literacy training after the initial training described in <a href="#at-2_smt.a.1">AT-2a.1</a> is conducted at a minimum frequency consistent with applicable laws, directives, regulations, and policies. Subsequent literacy training may be satisfied by one or more short ad hoc sessions and include topical information on recent attack schemes, changes to organizational security and privacy policies, revised security and privacy expectations, or a subset of topics from the initial training. Updating literacy training and awareness content on a regular basis helps to ensure that the content remains relevant. Events that may precipitate an update to literacy training and awareness content include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.</p>

<h3 id="at-2-2-insider-threat">AT-2 (2): Insider Threat</h3>
<p>Provide literacy training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.</p>
<p>Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threat can include behaviors such as inordinate, long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain access to information not required for job performance; unexplained access to financial resources; bullying or harassment of fellow employees; workplace violence; and other serious violations of policies, procedures, directives, regulations, rules, or practices. Literacy training includes how to communicate the concerns of employees and management regarding potential indicators of insider threat through channels established by the organization and in accordance with established policies and procedures. Organizations may consider tailoring insider threat awareness topics to the role. For example, training for managers may be focused on changes in the behavior of team members, while training for employees may be focused on more general observations.</p>

<p>Provide role-based security and privacy training to personnel with the following roles and responsibilities: organization-defined roles and responsibilities:</p>
<p>Before authorizing access to the system, information, or performing assigned duties, and the frequency at which to provide role-based security and privacy training to assigned personnel after initial training is defined; thereafter; and</p>
<p>When required by system changes;</p>
<p>Update role-based training content the frequency at which to update role-based training content is defined; and following events that require role-based training content to be updated are defined; ; and</p>
<p>Incorporate lessons learned from internal or external security incidents or breaches into role-based training.</p>
<p>Organizations determine the content of training based on the assigned roles and responsibilities of individuals as well as the security and privacy requirements of organizations and the systems to which personnel have authorized access, including technical training specifically tailored for assigned duties. Roles that may require role-based training include senior leaders or management officials (e.g., head of agency/chief executive officer, chief information officer, senior accountable official for risk management, senior agency information security officer, senior agency official for privacy), system owners; authorizing officials; system security officers; privacy officers; acquisition and procurement officials; enterprise architects; systems engineers; software developers; systems security engineers; privacy engineers; system, network, and database administrators; auditors; personnel conducting configuration management activities; personnel performing verification and validation activities; personnel with access to system-level software; control assessors; personnel with contingency planning and incident response duties; personnel with privacy management responsibilities; and personnel with access to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and responsibilities covering physical, personnel, and technical controls. Role-based training also includes policies, procedures, tools, methods, and artifacts for the security and privacy roles defined. Organizations provide the training necessary for individuals to fulfill their responsibilities related to operations and supply chain risk management within the context of organizational security and privacy programs. Role-based training also applies to contractors who provide services to federal agencies. Types of training include web-based and computer-based training, classroom-style training, and hands-on training (including micro-training). Updating role-based training on a regular basis helps to ensure that the content remains relevant and effective. Events that may precipitate an update to role-based training content include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.</p>
