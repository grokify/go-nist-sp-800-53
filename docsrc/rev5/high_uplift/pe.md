# PE - Physical and Environmental Protection

* Controls: 7

## Controls

### PE-3 (1): System Access

Enforce physical access authorizations to the system in addition to the physical access controls for the facility at {{ insert: param, pe-03.01_odp }}.

Control of physical access to the system provides additional physical security for those areas within facilities where there is a concentration of system components.

physical access authorizations to the system are enforced;

physical access controls are enforced for the facility at {{ insert: param, pe-03.01_odp }}.

### PE-6 (4): Monitoring Physical Access to Systems

Monitor physical access to the system in addition to the physical access monitoring of the facility at {{ insert: param, pe-06.04_odp }}.

Monitoring physical access to systems provides additional monitoring for those areas within facilities where there is a concentration of system components, including server rooms, media storage areas, and communications centers. Physical access monitoring can be coordinated with intrusion detection systems and system monitoring capabilities to provide comprehensive and integrated threat coverage for the organization.

physical access to the system is monitored in addition to the physical access monitoring of the facility at {{ insert: param, pe-06.04_odp }}.

### PE-8 (1): Automated Records Maintenance and Review

Maintain and review visitor access records using {{ insert: param, pe-8.1_prm_1 }}.

Visitor access records may be stored and maintained in a database management system that is accessible by organizational personnel. Automated access to such records facilitates record reviews on a regular basis to determine if access authorizations are current and still required to support organizational mission and business functions.

visitor access records are maintained using {{ insert: param, pe-08.01_odp.01 }};

visitor access records are reviewed using {{ insert: param, pe-08.01_odp.02 }}.

### PE-11 (1): Alternate Power Supply — Minimal Operational Capability

Provide an alternate power supply for the system that is activated {{ insert: param, pe-11.01_odp }} and that can maintain minimally required operational capability in the event of an extended loss of the primary power source.

Provision of an alternate power supply with minimal operating capability can be satisfied by accessing a secondary commercial power supply or other external power supply.

an alternate power supply provided for the system is activated {{ insert: param, pe-11.01_odp }};

the alternate power supply provided for the system can maintain minimally required operational capability in the event of an extended loss of the primary power source.

### PE-13 (2): Suppression Systems — Automatic Activation and Notification

Employ fire suppression systems that activate automatically and notify {{ insert: param, pe-13.02_odp.01 }} and {{ insert: param, pe-13.02_odp.02 }} ; and

Employ an automatic fire suppression capability when the facility is not staffed on a continuous basis.

Organizations can identify specific personnel, roles, and emergency responders if individuals on the notification list need to have appropriate access authorizations and/or clearances (e.g., to enter to facilities where access is restricted due to the impact level or classification of information within the facility). Notification mechanisms may require independent energy sources to ensure that the notification capability is not adversely affected by the fire.

fire suppression systems that activate automatically are employed;

fire suppression systems that notify {{ insert: param, pe-13.02_odp.01 }} automatically are employed;

fire suppression systems that notify {{ insert: param, pe-13.02_odp.02 }} automatically are employed;

an automatic fire suppression capability is employed when the facility is not staffed on a continuous basis.

### PE-15 (1): Automation Support

Detect the presence of water near the system and alert {{ insert: param, pe-15.01_odp.01 }} using {{ insert: param, pe-15.01_odp.02 }}.

Automated mechanisms include notification systems, water detection sensors, and alarms.

the presence of water near the system can be detected automatically;

 {{ insert: param, pe-15.01_odp.01 }} is/are alerted using {{ insert: param, pe-15.01_odp.02 }}.

### PE-18: Location of System Components

Position system components within the facility to minimize potential damage from {{ insert: param, pe-18_odp }} and to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access.

Physical and environmental hazards include floods, fires, tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes, terrorism, vandalism, an electromagnetic pulse, electrical interference, and other forms of incoming electromagnetic radiation. Organizations consider the location of entry points where unauthorized individuals, while not being granted access, might nonetheless be near systems. Such proximity can increase the risk of unauthorized access to organizational communications using wireless packet sniffers or microphones, or unauthorized disclosure of information.

system components are positioned within the facility to minimize potential damage from {{ insert: param, pe-18_odp }} and to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access.
