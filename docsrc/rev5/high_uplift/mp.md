Organizations review and approve media to be sanitized to ensure compliance with records retention policies. Tracking and documenting actions include listing personnel who reviewed and approved sanitization and disposal actions, types of media sanitized, files stored on the media, sanitization methods used, date and time of the sanitization actions, personnel who performed the sanitization, verification actions taken and personnel who performed the verification, and the disposal actions taken. Organizations verify that the sanitization of the media was effective prior to disposal.

media sanitization and disposal actions are reviewed;

media sanitization and disposal actions are approved;

media sanitization and disposal actions are tracked;

media sanitization and disposal actions are documented;

media sanitization and disposal actions are verified.

### MP-6 (3): Nondestructive Techniques

Apply nondestructive sanitization techniques to portable storage devices prior to connecting such devices to the system under the following circumstances: circumstances requiring sanitization of portable storage devices are defined;.

Portable storage devices include external or removable hard disk drives (e.g., solid state, magnetic), optical discs, magnetic or optical tapes, flash memory devices, flash memory cards, and other external or removable disks. Portable storage devices can be obtained from untrustworthy sources and contain malicious code that can be inserted into or transferred to organizational systems through USB ports or other entry portals. While scanning storage devices is recommended, sanitization provides additional assurance that such devices are free of malicious code. Organizations consider nondestructive sanitization of portable storage devices when the devices are purchased from manufacturers or vendors prior to initial use or when organizations cannot maintain a positive chain of custody for the devices.

non-destructive sanitization techniques are applied to portable storage devices prior to connecting such devices to the system under circumstances requiring sanitization of portable storage devices are defined;.
