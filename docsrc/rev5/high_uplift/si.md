# SI - System and Information Integrity

* Controls: 10

## Controls

### SI-4 (10): Visibility of Encrypted Communications

Make provisions so that {{ insert: param, si-04.10_odp.01 }} is visible to {{ insert: param, si-04.10_odp.02 }}.

Organizations balance the need to encrypt communications traffic to protect data confidentiality with the need to maintain visibility into such traffic from a monitoring perspective. Organizations determine whether the visibility requirement applies to internal encrypted traffic, encrypted traffic intended for external destinations, or a subset of the traffic types.

provisions are made so that {{ insert: param, si-04.10_odp.01 }} is visible to {{ insert: param, si-04.10_odp.02 }}.

### SI-4 (12): Automated Organization-generated Alerts

Alert {{ insert: param, si-04.12_odp.01 }} using {{ insert: param, si-04.12_odp.02 }} when the following indications of inappropriate or unusual activities with security or privacy implications occur: {{ insert: param, si-04.12_odp.03 }}.

Organizational personnel on the system alert notification list include system administrators, mission or business owners, system owners, senior agency information security officer, senior agency official for privacy, system security officers, or privacy officers. Automated organization-generated alerts are the security alerts generated by organizations and transmitted using automated means. The sources for organization-generated alerts are focused on other entities such as suspicious activity reports and reports on potential insider threats. In contrast to alerts generated by the organization, alerts generated by the system in [SI-4(5)](#si-4.5) focus on information sources that are internal to the systems, such as audit records.

 {{ insert: param, si-04.12_odp.01 }} is/are alerted using {{ insert: param, si-04.12_odp.02 }} when {{ insert: param, si-04.12_odp.03 }} indicate inappropriate or unusual activities with security or privacy implications.

### SI-4 (14): Wireless Intrusion Detection

Employ a wireless intrusion detection system to identify rogue wireless devices and to detect attack attempts and potential compromises or breaches to the system.

Wireless signals may radiate beyond organizational facilities. Organizations proactively search for unauthorized wireless connections, including the conduct of thorough scans for unauthorized wireless access points. Wireless scans are not limited to those areas within facilities containing systems but also include areas outside of facilities to verify that unauthorized wireless access points are not connected to organizational systems.

a wireless intrusion detection system is employed to identify rogue wireless devices;

a wireless intrusion detection system is employed to detect attack attempts on the system;

a wireless intrusion detection system is employed to detect potential compromises or breaches to the system.

### SI-4 (20): Privileged Users

Implement the following additional monitoring of privileged users: {{ insert: param, si-04.20_odp }}.

Privileged users have access to more sensitive information, including security-related information, than the general user population. Access to such information means that privileged users can potentially do greater damage to systems and organizations than non-privileged users. Therefore, implementing additional monitoring on privileged users helps to ensure that organizations can identify malicious activity at the earliest possible time and take appropriate actions.

 {{ insert: param, si-04.20_odp }} of privileged users is implemented.

### SI-4 (22): Unauthorized Network Services

Detect network services that have not been authorized or approved by {{ insert: param, si-04.22_odp.01 }} ; and

 {{ insert: param, si-04.22_odp.02 }} when detected.

Unauthorized or unapproved network services include services in service-oriented architectures that lack organizational verification or validation and may therefore be unreliable or serve as malicious rogues for valid services.

network services that have not been authorized or approved by {{ insert: param, si-04.22_odp.01 }} are detected;

 {{ insert: param, si-04.22_odp.02 }} is/are initiated when network services that have not been authorized or approved by authorization or approval processes are detected.

### SI-5 (1): Automated Alerts and Advisories

Broadcast security alert and advisory information throughout the organization using {{ insert: param, si-05.01_odp }}.

The significant number of changes to organizational systems and environments of operation requires the dissemination of security-related information to a variety of organizational entities that have a direct interest in the success of organizational mission and business functions. Based on information provided by security alerts and advisories, changes may be required at one or more of the three levels related to the management of risk, including the governance level, mission and business process level, and the information system level.

 {{ insert: param, si-05.01_odp }} are used to broadcast security alert and advisory information throughout the organization.

### SI-6: Security and Privacy Function Verification

Verify the correct operation of {{ insert: param, si-6_prm_1 }};

Perform the verification of the functions specified in SI-6a {{ insert: param, si-06_odp.03 }};

Alert {{ insert: param, si-06_odp.06 }} to failed security and privacy verification tests; and

 {{ insert: param, si-06_odp.07 }} when anomalies are discovered.

Transitional states for systems include system startup, restart, shutdown, and abort. System notifications include hardware indicator lights, electronic alerts to system administrators, and messages to local computer consoles. In contrast to security function verification, privacy function verification ensures that privacy functions operate as expected and are approved by the senior agency official for privacy or that privacy attributes are applied or used as expected.

 {{ insert: param, si-06_odp.01 }} are verified to be operating correctly;

 {{ insert: param, si-06_odp.02 }} are verified to be operating correctly;

 {{ insert: param, si-06_odp.01 }} are verified {{ insert: param, si-06_odp.03 }};

 {{ insert: param, si-06_odp.02 }} are verified {{ insert: param, si-06_odp.03 }};

 {{ insert: param, si-06_odp.06 }} is/are alerted to failed security verification tests;

 {{ insert: param, si-06_odp.06 }} is/are alerted to failed privacy verification tests;

 {{ insert: param, si-06_odp.07 }} is/are initiated when anomalies are discovered.

### SI-7 (2): Automated Notifications of Integrity Violations

Employ automated tools that provide notification to {{ insert: param, si-07.02_odp }} upon discovering discrepancies during integrity verification.

The employment of automated tools to report system and information integrity violations and to notify organizational personnel in a timely matter is essential to effective risk response. Personnel with an interest in system and information integrity violations include mission and business owners, system owners, senior agency information security official, senior agency official for privacy, system administrators, software developers, systems integrators, information security officers, and privacy officers.

### SI-7 (5): Automated Response to Integrity Violations

Automatically {{ insert: param, si-07.05_odp.01 }} when integrity violations are discovered.

Organizations may define different integrity-checking responses by type of information, specific information, or a combination of both. Types of information include firmware, software, and user data. Specific information includes boot firmware for certain types of machines. The automatic implementation of controls within organizational systems includes reversing the changes, halting the system, or triggering audit alerts when unauthorized modifications to critical security files occur.

### SI-7 (15): Code Authentication

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate the following software or firmware components prior to installation: {{ insert: param, si-07.15_odp }}.

Cryptographic authentication includes verifying that software or firmware components have been digitally signed using certificates recognized and approved by organizations. Code signing is an effective method to protect against malicious code. Organizations that employ cryptographic mechanisms also consider cryptographic key management solutions.
