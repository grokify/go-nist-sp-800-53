## Controls

### SI-4 (10): Visibility of Encrypted Communications

Make provisions so that encrypted communications traffic to be made visible to system monitoring tools and mechanisms is defined; is visible to system monitoring tools and mechanisms to be provided access to encrypted communications traffic are defined;.

Organizations balance the need to encrypt communications traffic to protect data confidentiality with the need to maintain visibility into such traffic from a monitoring perspective. Organizations determine whether the visibility requirement applies to internal encrypted traffic, encrypted traffic intended for external destinations, or a subset of the traffic types.

Alert personnel or roles to be alerted when indications of inappropriate or unusual activity with security or privacy implications occur is/are defined; using automated mechanisms used to alert personnel or roles are defined; when the following indications of inappropriate or unusual activities with security or privacy implications occur: activities that trigger alerts to personnel or are defined;.

Organizational personnel on the system alert notification list include system administrators, mission or business owners, system owners, senior agency information security officer, senior agency official for privacy, system security officers, or privacy officers. Automated organization-generated alerts are the security alerts generated by organizations and transmitted using automated means. The sources for organization-generated alerts are focused on other entities such as suspicious activity reports and reports on potential insider threats. In contrast to alerts generated by the organization, alerts generated by the system in [SI-4(5)](#si-4.5) focus on information sources that are internal to the systems, such as audit records.

### SI-4 (14): Wireless Intrusion Detection

Employ a wireless intrusion detection system to identify rogue wireless devices and to detect attack attempts and potential compromises or breaches to the system.

Wireless signals may radiate beyond organizational facilities. Organizations proactively search for unauthorized wireless connections, including the conduct of thorough scans for unauthorized wireless access points. Wireless scans are not limited to those areas within facilities containing systems but also include areas outside of facilities to verify that unauthorized wireless access points are not connected to organizational systems.

### SI-4 (20): Privileged Users

Implement the following additional monitoring of privileged users: additional monitoring of privileged users is defined;.

Privileged users have access to more sensitive information, including security-related information, than the general user population. Access to such information means that privileged users can potentially do greater damage to systems and organizations than non-privileged users. Therefore, implementing additional monitoring on privileged users helps to ensure that organizations can identify malicious activity at the earliest possible time and take appropriate actions.

 additional monitoring of privileged users is defined; of privileged users is implemented.

The significant number of changes to organizational systems and environments of operation requires the dissemination of security-related information to a variety of organizational entities that have a direct interest in the success of organizational mission and business functions. Based on information provided by security alerts and advisories, changes may be required at one or more of the three levels related to the management of risk, including the governance level, mission and business process level, and the information system level.
