## Controls

### CP-2 (2): Capacity Planning

Conduct capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information processing, telecommunications, and environmental support exists during contingency operations.

Capacity planning is needed because different threats can result in a reduction of the available processing, telecommunications, and support services intended to support essential mission and business functions. Organizations anticipate degraded operations during contingency operations and factor the degradation into capacity planning. For capacity planning, environmental support refers to any environmental factor for which the organization determines that it needs to provide support in a contingency situation, even if in a degraded state. Such determinations are based on an organizational assessment of risk, system categorization (impact level), and organizational risk tolerance.

capacity planning is conducted so that the necessary capacity exists during contingency operations for information processing;

capacity planning is conducted so that the necessary capacity exists during contingency operations for telecommunications;

### CP-2 (5): Continue Mission and Business Functions

Plan for the continuance of alloressential mission and business functions with minimal or no loss of operational continuity and sustains that continuity until full system restoration at primary processing and/or storage sites.

Organizations may choose to conduct the contingency planning activities to continue mission and business functions as part of business continuity planning or business impact analyses. Primary processing and/or storage sites defined by organizations as part of contingency planning may change depending on the circumstances associated with the contingency.

### CP-3 (1): Simulated Events

Incorporate simulated events into contingency training to facilitate effective response by personnel in crisis situations.

The use of simulated events creates an environment for personnel to experience actual threat events, including cyber-attacks that disable websites, ransomware attacks that encrypt organizational data on servers, hurricanes that damage or destroy organizational facilities, or hardware or software failures.

### CP-4 (2): Alternate Processing Site

Test the contingency plan at the alternate processing site:

To familiarize contingency personnel with the facility and available resources; and

To evaluate the capabilities of the alternate processing site to support contingency operations.

Conditions at the alternate processing site may be significantly different than the conditions at the primary site. Having the opportunity to visit the alternate site and experience the actual capabilities available at the site can provide valuable information on potential vulnerabilities that could affect essential organizational mission and business functions. The on-site visit can also provide an opportunity to refine the contingency plan to address the vulnerabilities discovered during testing.

### CP-7 (4): Preparation for Use

Prepare the alternate processing site so that the site can serve as the operational site supporting essential mission and business functions.

Site preparation includes establishing configuration settings for systems at the alternate processing site consistent with the requirements for such settings at the primary site and ensuring that essential supplies and logistical considerations are in place.

### CP-8 (3): Separation of Primary and Alternate Providers

Obtain alternate telecommunications services from providers that are separated from primary service providers to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.

Threats that affect telecommunications services are defined in organizational assessments of risk and include natural disasters, structural failures, cyber or physical attacks, and errors of omission or commission. Organizations can reduce common susceptibilities by minimizing shared infrastructure among telecommunications service providers and achieving sufficient geographic separation between services. Organizations may consider using a single service provider in situations where the service provider can provide alternate telecommunications services that meet the separation needs addressed in the risk assessment.

alternate telecommunications services from providers that are separated from primary service providers are obtained to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.

### CP-8 (4): Provider Contingency Plan

Require primary and alternate telecommunications service providers to have contingency plans;

Review provider contingency plans to ensure that the plans meet organizational contingency requirements; and

Obtain evidence of contingency testing and training by providers organization-defined frequency.

Reviews of provider contingency plans consider the proprietary nature of such plans. In some situations, a summary of provider contingency plans may be sufficient evidence for organizations to satisfy the review requirement. Telecommunications service providers may also participate in ongoing disaster recovery exercises in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security and state and local governments. Organizations may use these types of activities to satisfy evidentiary requirements related to service provider contingency plan reviews, testing, and training.

primary telecommunications service providers are required to have contingency plans;

alternate telecommunications service providers are required to have contingency plans;

provider contingency plans are reviewed to ensure that the plans meet organizational contingency requirements;

evidence of contingency testing by providers is obtained frequency at which to obtain evidence of contingency testing by providers is defined;.

evidence of contingency training by providers is obtained frequency at which to obtain evidence of contingency training by providers is defined;.

### CP-9 (2): Test Restoration Using Sampling

Use a sample of backup information in the restoration of selected system functions as part of contingency plan testing.

Organizations need assurance that system functions can be restored correctly and can support established organizational missions. To ensure that the selected system functions are thoroughly exercised during contingency plan testing, a sample of backup information is retrieved to determine whether the functions are operating as intended. Organizations can determine the sample size for the functions and backup information based on the level of assurance needed.

### CP-9 (3): Separate Storage for Critical Information

Store backup copies of critical system software and other security-related information backups to be stored in a separate facility are defined; in a separate facility or in a fire rated container that is not collocated with the operational system.

Separate storage for critical information applies to all critical information regardless of the type of backup storage media. Critical system software includes operating systems, middleware, cryptographic key management systems, and intrusion detection systems. Security-related information includes inventories of system hardware, software, and firmware components. Alternate storage sites, including geographically distributed architectures, serve as separate storage facilities for organizations. Organizations may provide separate storage by implementing automated backup processes at alternative storage sites (e.g., data centers). The General Services Administration (GSA) establishes standards and specifications for security and fire rated containers.

backup copies of critical system software and other security-related information backups to be stored in a separate facility are defined; are stored in a separate facility or in a fire rated container that is not collocated with the operational system.
