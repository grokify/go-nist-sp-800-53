# IR - Incident Response

* Controls Count: 5
* Controls IDs: IR-2 (1), IR-2 (2), IR-4 (4), IR-4 (11), IR-5 (1)

## Controls

### IR-2 (1): Simulated Events

Incorporate simulated events into incident response training to facilitate the required response by personnel in crisis situations.

Organizations establish requirements for responding to incidents in incident response plans. Incorporating simulated events into incident response training helps to ensure that personnel understand their individual responsibilities and what specific actions to take in crisis situations.

simulated events are incorporated into incident response training to facilitate the required response by personnel in crisis situations.

### IR-2 (2): Automated Training Environments

Provide an incident response training environment using automated mechanisms used in an incident response training environment are defined;.

Automated mechanisms can provide a more thorough and realistic incident response training environment. This can be accomplished, for example, by providing more complete coverage of incident response issues, selecting more realistic training scenarios and environments, and stressing the response capability.

### IR-4 (4): Information Correlation

Correlate incident information and individual incident responses to achieve an organization-wide perspective on incident awareness and response.

Sometimes, a threat event, such as a hostile cyber-attack, can only be observed by bringing together information from different sources, including various reports and reporting procedures established by organizations.

incident information and individual incident responses are correlated to achieve an organization-wide perspective on incident awareness and response.

### IR-4 (11): Integrated Incident Response Team

Establish and maintain an integrated incident response team that can be deployed to any location identified by the organization in the time period within which an integrated incident response team can be deployed is defined;.

An integrated incident response team is a team of experts that assesses, documents, and responds to incidents so that organizational systems and networks can recover quickly and implement the necessary controls to avoid future incidents. Incident response team personnel include forensic and malicious code analysts, tool developers, systems security and privacy engineers, and real-time operations personnel. The incident handling capability includes performing rapid forensic preservation of evidence and analysis of and response to intrusions. For some organizations, the incident response team can be a cross-organizational entity.

An integrated incident response team facilitates information sharing and allows organizational personnel (e.g., developers, implementers, and operators) to leverage team knowledge of the threat and implement defensive measures that enable organizations to deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, integrated teams promote the rapid detection of intrusions, the development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective defensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected, the integrated team can rapidly develop an appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate the new incident with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing cyber intelligence development. Integrated incident response teams are better able to identify adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures that are linked to the operations tempo or specific mission and business functions and to define responsive actions in a way that does not disrupt those mission and business functions. Incident response teams can be distributed within organizations to make the capability resilient.
