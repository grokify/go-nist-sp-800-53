* Controls: 9

## Controls

### AU-5 (1): Storage Capacity Warning

Provide a warning to {{ insert: param, au-05.01_odp.01 }} within {{ insert: param, au-05.01_odp.02 }} when allocated audit log storage volume reaches {{ insert: param, au-05.01_odp.03 }} of repository maximum audit log storage capacity.

Organizations may have multiple audit log storage repositories distributed across multiple system components with each repository having different storage volume capacities.

a warning is provided to {{ insert: param, au-05.01_odp.01 }} within {{ insert: param, au-05.01_odp.02 }} when allocated audit log storage volume reaches {{ insert: param, au-05.01_odp.03 }} of repository maximum audit log storage capacity.

### AU-5 (2): Real-time Alerts

Provide an alert within {{ insert: param, au-05.02_odp.01 }} to {{ insert: param, au-05.02_odp.02 }} when the following audit failure events occur: {{ insert: param, au-05.02_odp.03 }}.

Alerts provide organizations with urgent messages. Real-time alerts provide these messages at information technology speed (i.e., the time from event detection to alert occurs in seconds or less).

an alert is provided within {{ insert: param, au-05.02_odp.01 }} to {{ insert: param, au-05.02_odp.02 }} when {{ insert: param, au-05.02_odp.03 }} occur.

### AU-6 (5): Integrated Analysis of Audit Records

Integrate analysis of audit records with analysis of {{ insert: param, au-06.05_odp.01 }} to further enhance the ability to identify inappropriate or unusual activity.

Integrated analysis of audit records does not require vulnerability scanning, the generation of performance data, or system monitoring. Rather, integrated analysis requires that the analysis of information generated by scanning, monitoring, or other data collection activities is integrated with the analysis of audit record information. Security Information and Event Management tools can facilitate audit record aggregation or consolidation from multiple system components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with localized script adjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit record information collected. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans of the system and in correlating attack detection events with scanning results. Correlation with performance data can uncover denial-of-service attacks or other types of attacks that result in the unauthorized use of resources. Correlation with system monitoring information can assist in uncovering attacks and in better relating audit information to operational situations.

analysis of audit records is integrated with analysis of {{ insert: param, au-06.05_odp.01 }} to further enhance the ability to identify inappropriate or unusual activity.

### AU-6 (6): Correlation with Physical Monitoring

Correlate information from audit records with information obtained from monitoring physical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate, unusual, or malevolent activity.

The correlation of physical audit record information and the audit records from systems may assist organizations in identifying suspicious behavior or supporting evidence of such behavior. For example, the correlation of an individualâ€™s identity for logical access to certain systems with the additional physical security information that the individual was present at the facility when the logical access occurred may be useful in investigations.

information from audit records is correlated with information obtained from monitoring physical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate, unusual, or malevolent activity.

### AU-9 (2): Store on Separate Physical Systems or Components

Store audit records {{ insert: param, au-09.02_odp }} in a repository that is part of a physically different system or system component than the system or component being audited.

Storing audit records in a repository separate from the audited system or system component helps to ensure that a compromise of the system being audited does not also result in a compromise of the audit records. Storing audit records on separate physical systems or components also preserves the confidentiality and integrity of audit records and facilitates the management of audit records as an organization-wide activity. Storing audit records on separate systems or components applies to initial generation as well as backup or long-term storage of audit records.

audit records are stored {{ insert: param, au-09.02_odp }} in a repository that is part of a physically different system or system component than the system or component being audited.

### AU-9 (3): Cryptographic Protection

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit information and audit tools.

Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of audit information include signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography. This enables the distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.

cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit information and audit tools are implemented.

### AU-10: Non-repudiation

Provide irrefutable evidence that an individual (or process acting on behalf of an individual) has performed {{ insert: param, au-10_odp }}.

Types of individual actions covered by non-repudiation include creating information, sending and receiving messages, and approving information. Non-repudiation protects against claims by authors of not having authored certain documents, senders of not having transmitted messages, receivers of not having received messages, and signatories of not having signed documents. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information originated from an individual or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a contract, approving a procurement request, or receiving specific information). Organizations obtain non-repudiation services by employing various techniques or mechanisms, including digital signatures and digital message receipts.

irrefutable evidence is provided that an individual (or process acting on behalf of an individual) has performed {{ insert: param, au-10_odp }}.

### AU-12 (1): System-wide and Time-correlated Audit Trail

Compile audit records from {{ insert: param, au-12.01_odp.01 }} into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-correlated to within {{ insert: param, au-12.01_odp.02 }}.

Audit trails are time-correlated if the time stamps in the individual audit records can be reliably related to the time stamps in other audit records to achieve a time ordering of the records within organizational tolerances.

### AU-12 (3): Changes by Authorized Individuals

Provide and implement the capability for {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.01 }} to change the logging to be performed on {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.02 }} based on {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.03 }} within {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.04 }}.

Permitting authorized individuals to make changes to system logging enables organizations to extend or limit logging as necessary to meet organizational requirements. Logging that is limited to conserve system resources may be extended (either temporarily or permanently) to address certain threat situations. In addition, logging may be limited to a specific set of event types to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting. Organizations can establish time thresholds in which logging actions are changed (e.g., near real-time, within minutes, or within hours).

the capability for {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.01 }} to change the logging to be performed on {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.02 }} based on {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.03 }} within {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.04 }} is provided;
