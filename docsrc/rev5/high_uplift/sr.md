# SR - Supply Chain Risk Management

* Controls: 2

## Controls

### SR-9: Tamper Resistance and Detection

Implement a tamper protection program for the system, system component, or system service.

Anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques provide a level of protection for systems, system components, and services against many threats, including reverse engineering, modification, and substitution. Strong identification combined with tamper resistance and/or tamper detection is essential to protecting systems and components during distribution and when in use.

a tamper protection program is implemented for the system, system component, or system service.

### SR-9 (1): Multiple Stages of System Development Life Cycle

Employ anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques throughout the system development life cycle.

The system development life cycle includes research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal. Organizations use a combination of hardware and software techniques for tamper resistance and detection. Organizations use obfuscation and self-checking to make reverse engineering and modifications more difficult, time-consuming, and expensive for adversaries. The customization of systems and system components can make substitutions easier to detect and therefore limit damage.

anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques are employed throughout the system development life cycle.
