## Controls

### cp-1: Policy and Procedures

Develop, document, and disseminate to {{ insert: param, cp-1_prm_1 }}:

 {{ insert: param, cp-01_odp.03 }} contingency planning policy that:

Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and

Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and

Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the contingency planning policy and the associated contingency planning controls;

Designate an {{ insert: param, cp-01_odp.04 }} to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the contingency planning policy and procedures; and

Review and update the current contingency planning:

Policy {{ insert: param, cp-01_odp.05 }} and following {{ insert: param, cp-01_odp.06 }} ; and

Procedures {{ insert: param, cp-01_odp.07 }} and following {{ insert: param, cp-01_odp.08 }}.

Contingency planning policy and procedures address the controls in the CP family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of contingency planning policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to contingency planning policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

### cp-2: Contingency Plan

Develop a contingency plan for the system that:

Identifies essential mission and business functions and associated contingency requirements;

Provides recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics;

Addresses contingency roles, responsibilities, assigned individuals with contact information;

Addresses maintaining essential mission and business functions despite a system disruption, compromise, or failure;

Addresses eventual, full system restoration without deterioration of the controls originally planned and implemented;

Addresses the sharing of contingency information; and

Is reviewed and approved by {{ insert: param, cp-2_prm_1 }};

Distribute copies of the contingency plan to {{ insert: param, cp-2_prm_2 }};

Coordinate contingency planning activities with incident handling activities;

Review the contingency plan for the system {{ insert: param, cp-02_odp.05 }};

Update the contingency plan to address changes to the organization, system, or environment of operation and problems encountered during contingency plan implementation, execution, or testing;

Communicate contingency plan changes to {{ insert: param, cp-2_prm_4 }};

Incorporate lessons learned from contingency plan testing, training, or actual contingency activities into contingency testing and training; and

Protect the contingency plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

Contingency planning for systems is part of an overall program for achieving continuity of operations for organizational mission and business functions. Contingency planning addresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes when systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the system development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be designed for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level.

Actions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation, system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities, organizations ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in the event of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during an incident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system, as specified in [IR-4(5)](#ir-4.5) . Incident response planning is part of contingency planning for organizations and is addressed in the [IR](#ir) (Incident Response) family.

### cp-2.2: Capacity Planning

Conduct capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information processing, telecommunications, and environmental support exists during contingency operations.

Capacity planning is needed because different threats can result in a reduction of the available processing, telecommunications, and support services intended to support essential mission and business functions. Organizations anticipate degraded operations during contingency operations and factor the degradation into capacity planning. For capacity planning, environmental support refers to any environmental factor for which the organization determines that it needs to provide support in a contingency situation, even if in a degraded state. Such determinations are based on an organizational assessment of risk, system categorization (impact level), and organizational risk tolerance.

capacity planning is conducted so that the necessary capacity exists during contingency operations for information processing;

Plan for the resumption of {{ insert: param, cp-02.03_odp.01 }} mission and business functions within {{ insert: param, cp-02.03_odp.02 }} of contingency plan activation.

Organizations may choose to conduct contingency planning activities to resume mission and business functions as part of business continuity planning or as part of business impact analyses. Organizations prioritize the resumption of mission and business functions. The time period for resuming mission and business functions may be dependent on the severity and extent of the disruptions to the system and its supporting infrastructure.

the resumption of {{ insert: param, cp-02.03_odp.01 }} mission and business functions are planned for within {{ insert: param, cp-02.03_odp.02 }} of contingency plan activation.

### cp-2.8: Identify Critical Assets

Identify critical system assets supporting {{ insert: param, cp-02.08_odp }} mission and business functions.

Organizations may choose to identify critical assets as part of criticality analysis, business continuity planning, or business impact analyses. Organizations identify critical system assets so that additional controls can be employed (beyond the controls routinely implemented) to help ensure that organizational mission and business functions can continue to be conducted during contingency operations. The identification of critical information assets also facilitates the prioritization of organizational resources. Critical system assets include technical and operational aspects. Technical aspects include system components, information technology services, information technology products, and mechanisms. Operational aspects include procedures (i.e., manually executed operations) and personnel (i.e., individuals operating technical controls and/or executing manual procedures). Organizational program protection plans can assist in identifying critical assets. If critical assets are resident within or supported by external service providers, organizations consider implementing [CP-2(7)](#cp-2.7) as a control enhancement.

### cp-3: Contingency Training

Provide contingency training to system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities:

Within {{ insert: param, cp-03_odp.01 }} of assuming a contingency role or responsibility;

When required by system changes; and

 {{ insert: param, cp-03_odp.02 }} thereafter; and

Review and update contingency training content {{ insert: param, cp-03_odp.03 }} and following {{ insert: param, cp-03_odp.04 }}.

Contingency training provided by organizations is linked to the assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For example, some individuals may only need to know when and where to report for duty during contingency operations and if normal duties are affected; system administrators may require additional training on how to establish systems at alternate processing and storage sites; and organizational officials may receive more specific training on how to conduct mission-essential functions in designated off-site locations and how to establish communications with other governmental entities for purposes of coordination on contingency-related activities. Training for contingency roles or responsibilities reflects the specific continuity requirements in the contingency plan. Events that may precipitate an update to contingency training content include, but are not limited to, contingency plan testing or an actual contingency (lessons learned), assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. At the discretion of the organization, participation in a contingency plan test or exercise, including lessons learned sessions subsequent to the test or exercise, may satisfy contingency plan training requirements.

contingency training is provided to system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities within {{ insert: param, cp-03_odp.01 }} of assuming a contingency role or responsibility;

contingency training is provided to system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities when required by system changes;

### cp-4: Contingency Plan Testing

Test the contingency plan for the system {{ insert: param, cp-04_odp.01 }} using the following tests to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the readiness to execute the plan: {{ insert: param, cp-4_prm_2 }}.

Review the contingency plan test results; and

Initiate corrective actions, if needed.

Methods for testing contingency plans to determine the effectiveness of the plans and identify potential weaknesses include checklists, walk-through and tabletop exercises, simulations (parallel or full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Organizations conduct testing based on the requirements in contingency plans and include a determination of the effects on organizational operations, assets, and individuals due to contingency operations. Organizations have flexibility and discretion in the breadth, depth, and timelines of corrective actions.

### cp-4.2: Alternate Processing Site

Test the contingency plan at the alternate processing site:

To familiarize contingency personnel with the facility and available resources; and

To evaluate the capabilities of the alternate processing site to support contingency operations.

Conditions at the alternate processing site may be significantly different than the conditions at the primary site. Having the opportunity to visit the alternate site and experience the actual capabilities available at the site can provide valuable information on potential vulnerabilities that could affect essential organizational mission and business functions. The on-site visit can also provide an opportunity to refine the contingency plan to address the vulnerabilities discovered during testing.

### cp-6: Alternate Storage Site

Establish an alternate storage site, including necessary agreements to permit the storage and retrieval of system backup information; and

Ensure that the alternate storage site provides controls equivalent to that of the primary site.

Alternate storage sites are geographically distinct from primary storage sites and maintain duplicate copies of information and data if the primary storage site is not available. Similarly, alternate processing sites provide processing capability if the primary processing site is not available. Geographically distributed architectures that support contingency requirements may be considered alternate storage sites. Items covered by alternate storage site agreements include environmental conditions at the alternate sites, access rules for systems and facilities, physical and environmental protection requirements, and coordination of delivery and retrieval of backup media. Alternate storage sites reflect the requirements in contingency plans so that organizations can maintain essential mission and business functions despite compromise, failure, or disruption in organizational systems.

### cp-6.1: Separation from Primary Site

Identify an alternate storage site that is sufficiently separated from the primary storage site to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.

Threats that affect alternate storage sites are defined in organizational risk assessments and include natural disasters, structural failures, hostile attacks, and errors of omission or commission. Organizations determine what is considered a sufficient degree of separation between primary and alternate storage sites based on the types of threats that are of concern. For threats such as hostile attacks, the degree of separation between sites is less relevant.

Establish an alternate processing site, including necessary agreements to permit the transfer and resumption of {{ insert: param, cp-07_odp.01 }} for essential mission and business functions within {{ insert: param, cp-07_odp.02 }} when the primary processing capabilities are unavailable;

Make available at the alternate processing site, the equipment and supplies required to transfer and resume operations or put contracts in place to support delivery to the site within the organization-defined time period for transfer and resumption; and

Provide controls at the alternate processing site that are equivalent to those at the primary site.

Alternate processing sites are geographically distinct from primary processing sites and provide processing capability if the primary processing site is not available. The alternate processing capability may be addressed using a physical processing site or other alternatives, such as failover to a cloud-based service provider or other internally or externally provided processing service. Geographically distributed architectures that support contingency requirements may also be considered alternate processing sites. Controls that are covered by alternate processing site agreements include the environmental conditions at alternate sites, access rules, physical and environmental protection requirements, and the coordination for the transfer and assignment of personnel. Requirements are allocated to alternate processing sites that reflect the requirements in contingency plans to maintain essential mission and business functions despite disruption, compromise, or failure in organizational systems.

an alternate processing site, including necessary agreements to permit the transfer and resumption of {{ insert: param, cp-07_odp.01 }} for essential mission and business functions, is established within {{ insert: param, cp-07_odp.02 }} when the primary processing capabilities are unavailable;

Telecommunications services (for data and voice) for primary and alternate processing and storage sites are in scope for [CP-8](#cp-8) . Alternate telecommunications services reflect the continuity requirements in contingency plans to maintain essential mission and business functions despite the loss of primary telecommunications services. Organizations may specify different time periods for primary or alternate sites. Alternate telecommunications services include additional organizational or commercial ground-based circuits or lines, network-based approaches to telecommunications, or the use of satellites. Organizations consider factors such as availability, quality of service, and access when entering into alternate telecommunications agreements.

Request Telecommunications Service Priority for all telecommunications services used for national security emergency preparedness if the primary and/or alternate telecommunications services are provided by a common carrier.

Organizations consider the potential mission or business impact in situations where telecommunications service providers are servicing other organizations with similar priority of service provisions. Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) is a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) program that directs telecommunications service providers (e.g., wireline and wireless phone companies) to give preferential treatment to users enrolled in the program when they need to add new lines or have their lines restored following a disruption of service, regardless of the cause. The FCC sets the rules and policies for the TSP program, and the Department of Homeland Security manages the TSP program. The TSP program is always in effect and not contingent on a major disaster or attack taking place. Federal sponsorship is required to enroll in the TSP program.

primary telecommunications service agreements that contain priority-of-service provisions in accordance with availability requirements (including recovery time objectives) are developed;

alternate telecommunications service agreements that contain priority-of-service provisions in accordance with availability requirements (including recovery time objectives) are developed;

Telecommunications Service Priority is requested for all telecommunications services used for national security emergency preparedness if the primary and/or alternate telecommunications services are provided by a common carrier.

### cp-8.3: Separation of Primary and Alternate Providers

Obtain alternate telecommunications services from providers that are separated from primary service providers to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.

Threats that affect telecommunications services are defined in organizational assessments of risk and include natural disasters, structural failures, cyber or physical attacks, and errors of omission or commission. Organizations can reduce common susceptibilities by minimizing shared infrastructure among telecommunications service providers and achieving sufficient geographic separation between services. Organizations may consider using a single service provider in situations where the service provider can provide alternate telecommunications services that meet the separation needs addressed in the risk assessment.

alternate telecommunications services from providers that are separated from primary service providers are obtained to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.

### cp-9.1: Testing for Reliability and Integrity

Test backup information {{ insert: param, cp-9.1_prm_1 }} to verify media reliability and information integrity.

Organizations need assurance that backup information can be reliably retrieved. Reliability pertains to the systems and system components where the backup information is stored, the operations used to retrieve the information, and the integrity of the information being retrieved. Independent and specialized tests can be used for each of the aspects of reliability. For example, decrypting and transporting (or transmitting) a random sample of backup files from the alternate storage or backup site and comparing the information to the same information at the primary processing site can provide such assurance.

backup information is tested {{ insert: param, cp-09.01_odp.01 }} to verify media reliability;

### cp-10: System Recovery and Reconstitution

Provide for the recovery and reconstitution of the system to a known state within {{ insert: param, cp-10_prm_1 }} after a disruption, compromise, or failure.

Recovery is executing contingency plan activities to restore organizational mission and business functions. Reconstitution takes place following recovery and includes activities for returning systems to fully operational states. Recovery and reconstitution operations reflect mission and business priorities; recovery point, recovery time, and reconstitution objectives; and organizational metrics consistent with contingency plan requirements. Reconstitution includes the deactivation of interim system capabilities that may have been needed during recovery operations. Reconstitution also includes assessments of fully restored system capabilities, reestablishment of continuous monitoring activities, system reauthorization (if required), and activities to prepare the system and organization for future disruptions, breaches, compromises, or failures. Recovery and reconstitution capabilities can include automated mechanisms and manual procedures. Organizations establish recovery time and recovery point objectives as part of contingency planning.
