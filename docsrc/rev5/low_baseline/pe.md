# PE - Physical and Environmental Protection

* Controls: 10

## Controls

### PE-1: Policy and Procedures

Develop, document, and disseminate to {{ insert: param, pe-1_prm_1 }}:

 {{ insert: param, pe-01_odp.03 }} physical and environmental protection policy that:

Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and

Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and

Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the physical and environmental protection policy and the associated physical and environmental protection controls;

Designate an {{ insert: param, pe-01_odp.04 }} to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the physical and environmental protection policy and procedures; and

Review and update the current physical and environmental protection:

Policy {{ insert: param, pe-01_odp.05 }} and following {{ insert: param, pe-01_odp.06 }} ; and

Procedures {{ insert: param, pe-01_odp.07 }} and following {{ insert: param, pe-01_odp.08 }}.

Physical and environmental protection policy and procedures address the controls in the PE family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of physical and environmental protection policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to physical and environmental protection policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

Physical access control applies to employees and visitors. Individuals with permanent physical access authorizations are not considered visitors. Physical access controls for publicly accessible areas may include physical access control logs/records, guards, or physical access devices and barriers to prevent movement from publicly accessible areas to non-public areas. Organizations determine the types of guards needed, including professional security staff, system users, or administrative staff. Physical access devices include keys, locks, combinations, biometric readers, and card readers. Physical access control systems comply with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural, automated, or some combination thereof. Physical access points can include facility access points, interior access points to systems that require supplemental access controls, or both. Components of systems may be in areas designated as publicly accessible with organizations controlling access to the components.

### PE-6: Monitoring Physical Access

Monitor physical access to the facility where the system resides to detect and respond to physical security incidents;

Review physical access logs {{ insert: param, pe-06_odp.01 }} and upon occurrence of {{ insert: param, pe-06_odp.02 }} ; and

Coordinate results of reviews and investigations with the organizational incident response capability.

Physical access monitoring includes publicly accessible areas within organizational facilities. Examples of physical access monitoring include the employment of guards, video surveillance equipment (i.e., cameras), and sensor devices. Reviewing physical access logs can help identify suspicious activity, anomalous events, or potential threats. The reviews can be supported by audit logging controls, such as [AU-2](#au-2) , if the access logs are part of an automated system. Organizational incident response capabilities include investigations of physical security incidents and responses to the incidents. Incidents include security violations or suspicious physical access activities. Suspicious physical access activities include accesses outside of normal work hours, repeated accesses to areas not normally accessed, accesses for unusual lengths of time, and out-of-sequence accesses.

physical access to the facility where the system resides is monitored to detect and respond to physical security incidents;

physical access logs are reviewed {{ insert: param, pe-06_odp.01 }};
