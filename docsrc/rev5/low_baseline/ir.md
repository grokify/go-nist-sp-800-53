# ir - Incident Response

* Controls: 7

## Controls

### ir-1: Policy and Procedures

Develop, document, and disseminate to {{ insert: param, ir-1_prm_1 }}:

 {{ insert: param, ir-01_odp.03 }} incident response policy that:

Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and

Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and

Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the incident response policy and the associated incident response controls;

Designate an {{ insert: param, ir-01_odp.04 }} to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the incident response policy and procedures; and

Review and update the current incident response:

Policy {{ insert: param, ir-01_odp.05 }} and following {{ insert: param, ir-01_odp.06 }} ; and

Procedures {{ insert: param, ir-01_odp.07 }} and following {{ insert: param, ir-01_odp.08 }}.

Incident response policy and procedures address the controls in the IR family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of incident response policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to incident response policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

### ir-2: Incident Response Training

Provide incident response training to system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities:

Within {{ insert: param, ir-02_odp.01 }} of assuming an incident response role or responsibility or acquiring system access;

When required by system changes; and

 {{ insert: param, ir-02_odp.02 }} thereafter; and

Review and update incident response training content {{ insert: param, ir-02_odp.03 }} and following {{ insert: param, ir-02_odp.04 }}.

Incident response training is associated with the assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail are included in such training. For example, users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle incidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, data collection techniques, reporting, system recovery, and system restoration. Incident response training includes user training in identifying and reporting suspicious activities from external and internal sources. Incident response training for users may be provided as part of [AT-2](#at-2) or [AT-3](#at-3) . Events that may precipitate an update to incident response training content include, but are not limited to, incident response plan testing or response to an actual incident (lessons learned), assessment or audit findings, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

### ir-4: Incident Handling

Implement an incident handling capability for incidents that is consistent with the incident response plan and includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery;

Coordinate incident handling activities with contingency planning activities;

Incorporate lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into incident response procedures, training, and testing, and implement the resulting changes accordingly; and

Ensure the rigor, intensity, scope, and results of incident handling activities are comparable and predictable across the organization.

Organizations recognize that incident response capabilities are dependent on the capabilities of organizational systems and the mission and business processes being supported by those systems. Organizations consider incident response as part of the definition, design, and development of mission and business processes and systems. Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources, including audit monitoring, physical access monitoring, and network monitoring; user or administrator reports; and reported supply chain events. An effective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities (e.g., mission or business owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical security offices, personnel security offices, legal departments, risk executive [function], operations personnel, procurement offices). Suspected security incidents include the receipt of suspicious email communications that can contain malicious code. Suspected supply chain incidents include the insertion of counterfeit hardware or malicious code into organizational systems or system components. For federal agencies, an incident that involves personally identifiable information is considered a breach. A breach results in unauthorized disclosure, the loss of control, unauthorized acquisition, compromise, or a similar occurrence where a person other than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable information or an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses such information for other than authorized purposes.

### ir-5: Incident Monitoring

Track and document incidents.

Documenting incidents includes maintaining records about each incident, the status of the incident, and other pertinent information necessary for forensics as well as evaluating incident details, trends, and handling. Incident information can be obtained from a variety of sources, including network monitoring, incident reports, incident response teams, user complaints, supply chain partners, audit monitoring, physical access monitoring, and user and administrator reports. [IR-4](#ir-4) provides information on the types of incidents that are appropriate for monitoring.

### ir-8: Incident Response Plan

Develop an incident response plan that:

Provides the organization with a roadmap for implementing its incident response capability;

Describes the structure and organization of the incident response capability;

Provides a high-level approach for how the incident response capability fits into the overall organization;

Meets the unique requirements of the organization, which relate to mission, size, structure, and functions;

Defines reportable incidents;

Provides metrics for measuring the incident response capability within the organization;

Defines the resources and management support needed to effectively maintain and mature an incident response capability;

Addresses the sharing of incident information;

Is reviewed and approved by {{ insert: param, ir-08_odp.01 }} {{ insert: param, ir-08_odp.02 }} ; and

Explicitly designates responsibility for incident response to {{ insert: param, ir-08_odp.03 }}.

Distribute copies of the incident response plan to {{ insert: param, ir-08_odp.04 }};

Update the incident response plan to address system and organizational changes or problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing;

Communicate incident response plan changes to {{ insert: param, ir-8_prm_5 }} ; and

Protect the incident response plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

It is important that organizations develop and implement a coordinated approach to incident response. Organizational mission and business functions determine the structure of incident response capabilities. As part of the incident response capabilities, organizations consider the coordination and sharing of information with external organizations, including external service providers and other organizations involved in the supply chain. For incidents involving personally identifiable information (i.e., breaches), include a process to determine whether notice to oversight organizations or affected individuals is appropriate and provide that notice accordingly.
