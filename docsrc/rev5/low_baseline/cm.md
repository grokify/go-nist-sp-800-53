## Controls

### CM-1: Policy and Procedures

Develop, document, and disseminate to organization-defined personnel or roles:

organization-level, mission/business process-level, and/or system-level configuration management policy that:

Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and

Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and

Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the configuration management policy and the associated configuration management controls;

Designate an an official to manage the configuration management policy and procedures is defined; to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the configuration management policy and procedures; and

Review and update the current configuration management:

Policy the frequency at which the current configuration management policy is reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require the current configuration management policy to be reviewed and updated are defined; ; and

Procedures the frequency at which the current configuration management procedures are reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require configuration management procedures to be reviewed and updated are defined;.

Configuration management policy and procedures address the controls in the CM family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of configuration management policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to configuration management policy and procedures include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

### CM-2: Baseline Configuration

Develop, document, and maintain under configuration control, a current baseline configuration of the system; and

Review and update the baseline configuration of the system:

the frequency of baseline configuration review and update is defined;;

When required due to the circumstances requiring baseline configuration review and update are defined; ; and

When system components are installed or upgraded.

Baseline configurations for systems and system components include connectivity, operational, and communications aspects of systems. Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed, and agreed-upon specifications for systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, or changes to systems and include security and privacy control implementations, operational procedures, information about system components, network topology, and logical placement of components in the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as organizational systems change over time. Baseline configurations of systems reflect the current enterprise architecture.

### CM-4: Impact Analyses

Analyze changes to the system to determine potential security and privacy impacts prior to change implementation.

Organizational personnel with security or privacy responsibilities conduct impact analyses. Individuals conducting impact analyses possess the necessary skills and technical expertise to analyze the changes to systems as well as the security or privacy ramifications. Impact analyses include reviewing security and privacy plans, policies, and procedures to understand control requirements; reviewing system design documentation and operational procedures to understand control implementation and how specific system changes might affect the controls; reviewing the impact of changes on organizational supply chain partners with stakeholders; and determining how potential changes to a system create new risks to the privacy of individuals and the ability of implemented controls to mitigate those risks. Impact analyses also include risk assessments to understand the impact of the changes and determine if additional controls are required.

### CM-5: Access Restrictions for Change

Define, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system.

Changes to the hardware, software, or firmware components of systems or the operational procedures related to the system can potentially have significant effects on the security of the systems or individuals’ privacy. Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access systems for purposes of initiating changes. Access restrictions include physical and logical access controls (see [AC-3](#ac-3) and [PE-3](#pe-3) ), software libraries, workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (i.e., changes implemented into external interfaces rather than directly into systems), and change windows (i.e., changes occur only during specified times).

### CM-6: Configuration Settings

Establish and document configuration settings for components employed within the system that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with operational requirements using common secure configurations to establish and document configuration settings for components employed within the system are defined;;

Implement the configuration settings;

Identify, document, and approve any deviations from established configuration settings for system components for which approval of deviations is needed are defined; based on operational requirements necessitating approval of deviations are defined; ; and

Monitor and control changes to the configuration settings in accordance with organizational policies and procedures.

Configuration settings are the parameters that can be changed in the hardware, software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security and privacy posture or functionality of the system. Information technology products for which configuration settings can be defined include mainframe computers, servers, workstations, operating systems, mobile devices, input/output devices, protocols, and applications. Parameters that impact the security posture of systems include registry settings; account, file, or directory permission settings; and settings for functions, protocols, ports, services, and remote connections. Privacy parameters are parameters impacting the privacy posture of systems, including the parameters required to satisfy other privacy controls. Privacy parameters include settings for access controls, data processing preferences, and processing and retention permissions. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific configuration settings for systems. The established settings become part of the configuration baseline for the system.

Common secure configurations (also known as security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, and security reference guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for information technology products and platforms as well as instructions for configuring those products or platforms to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations, including information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, federal agencies, consortia, academia, industry, and other organizations in the public and private sectors.

Implementation of a common secure configuration may be mandated at the organization level, mission and business process level, system level, or at a higher level, including by a regulatory agency. Common secure configurations include the United States Government Configuration Baseline [USGCB](#98498928-3ca3-44b3-8b1e-f48685373087) and security technical implementation guides (STIGs), which affect the implementation of [CM-6](#cm-6) and other controls such as [AC-19](#ac-19) and [CM-7](#cm-7) . The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control configuration settings.

### CM-7: Least Functionality

Configure the system to provide only mission-essential capabilities for the system are defined; ; and

Prohibit or restrict the use of the following functions, ports, protocols, software, and/or services: organization-defined prohibited or restricted functions, system ports, protocols, software, and/or services.

Systems provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services routinely provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single system component, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by that single component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per component. Organizations consider removing unused or unnecessary software and disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized connection of components, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations employ network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protection technologies, such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems, to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, protocols, ports, and services. Least functionality can also be achieved as part of the fundamental design and development of the system (see [SA-8](#sa-8), [SC-2](#sc-2) , and [SC-3](#sc-3)).

### CM-8: System Component Inventory

Develop and document an inventory of system components that:

Accurately reflects the system;

Includes all components within the system;

Does not include duplicate accounting of components or components assigned to any other system;

Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting; and

Includes the following information to achieve system component accountability: information deemed necessary to achieve effective system component accountability is defined; ; and

Review and update the system component inventory frequency at which to review and update the system component inventory is defined;.

System components are discrete, identifiable information technology assets that include hardware, software, and firmware. Organizations may choose to implement centralized system component inventories that include components from all organizational systems. In such situations, organizations ensure that the inventories include system-specific information required for component accountability. The information necessary for effective accountability of system components includes the system name, software owners, software version numbers, hardware inventory specifications, software license information, and for networked components, the machine names and network addresses across all implemented protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). Inventory specifications include date of receipt, cost, model, serial number, manufacturer, supplier information, component type, and physical location.

Preventing duplicate accounting of system components addresses the lack of accountability that occurs when component ownership and system association is not known, especially in large or complex connected systems. Effective prevention of duplicate accounting of system components necessitates use of a unique identifier for each component. For software inventory, centrally managed software that is accessed via other systems is addressed as a component of the system on which it is installed and managed. Software installed on multiple organizational systems and managed at the system level is addressed for each individual system and may appear more than once in a centralized component inventory, necessitating a system association for each software instance in the centralized inventory to avoid duplicate accounting of components. Scanning systems implementing multiple network protocols (e.g., IPv4 and IPv6) can result in duplicate components being identified in different address spaces. The implementation of [CM-8(7)](#cm-8.7) can help to eliminate duplicate accounting of components.
