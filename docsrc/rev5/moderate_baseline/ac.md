# AC - Access Control

* Controls: 39

## Controls

### AC-1: Policy and Procedures

Develop, document, and disseminate to organization-defined personnel or roles:

organization-level, mission/business process-level, and/or system-level access control policy that:

Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and

Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and

Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and the associated access controls;

Designate an an official to manage the access control policy and procedures is defined; to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the access control policy and procedures; and

Review and update the current access control:

Policy the frequency at which the current access control policy is reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require the current access control policy to be reviewed and updated are defined; ; and

Procedures the frequency at which the current access control procedures are reviewed and updated is defined; and following events that would require procedures to be reviewed and updated are defined;.

Access control policy and procedures address the controls in the AC family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of access control policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

### AC-2: Account Management

Define and document the types of accounts allowed and specifically prohibited for use within the system;

Assign account managers;

Require prerequisites and criteria for group and role membership are defined; for group and role membership;

Specify:

Authorized users of the system;

Group and role membership; and

Access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and attributes (as required) for each account are defined; for each account;

Require approvals by personnel or roles required to approve requests to create accounts is/are defined; for requests to create accounts;

Create, enable, modify, disable, and remove accounts in accordance with policy, procedures, prerequisites, and criteria for account creation, enabling, modification, disabling, and removal are defined;;

Monitor the use of accounts;

Notify account managers and personnel or roles to be notified is/are defined; within:

time period within which to notify account managers when accounts are no longer required is defined; when accounts are no longer required;

 time period within which to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred is defined; when users are terminated or transferred; and

 time period within which to notify account managers when system usage or the need to know changes for an individual is defined; when system usage or need-to-know changes for an individual;

Authorize access to the system based on:

A valid access authorization;

Intended system usage; and

 attributes needed to authorize system access (as required) are defined;;

Review accounts for compliance with account management requirements the frequency of account review is defined;;

Establish and implement a process for changing shared or group account authenticators (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group; and

Align account management processes with personnel termination and transfer processes.

Examples of system account types include individual, shared, group, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer, temporary, and service. Identification of authorized system users and the specification of access privileges reflect the requirements in other controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access, including system owner, mission or business owner, senior agency information security officer, or senior agency official for privacy. Types of accounts that organizations may wish to prohibit due to increased risk include shared, group, emergency, anonymous, temporary, and guest accounts.

Where access involves personally identifiable information, security programs collaborate with the senior agency official for privacy to establish the specific conditions for group and role membership; specify authorized users, group and role membership, and access authorizations for each account; and create, adjust, or remove system accounts in accordance with organizational policies. Policies can include such information as account expiration dates or other factors that trigger the disabling of accounts. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, type of account, or a combination of the two. Examples of other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on time of day, day of week, and point of origin. In defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements and mission/business requirements. Failure to consider these factors could affect system availability.

Temporary and emergency accounts are intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts, including local logon accounts used for special tasks or when network resources are unavailable (may also be known as accounts of last resort). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required and when individuals are transferred or terminated. Changing shared/group authenticators when members leave the group is intended to ensure that former group members do not retain access to the shared or group account. Some types of system accounts may require specialized training.

### AC-2 (13): Disable Accounts for High-risk Individuals

Disable accounts of individuals within time period within which to disable accounts of individuals who are discovered to pose significant risk is defined; of discovery of significant risks leading to disabling accounts are defined;.

Users who pose a significant security and/or privacy risk include individuals for whom reliable evidence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to systems to cause harm or through whom adversaries will cause harm. Such harm includes adverse impacts to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. Close coordination among system administrators, legal staff, human resource managers, and authorizing officials is essential when disabling system accounts for high-risk individuals.

### AC-3: Access Enforcement

Enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.

Access control policies control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (i.e., devices, files, records, domains) in organizational systems. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the system level and recognizing that systems can host many applications and services in support of mission and business functions, access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the application and service level to provide increased information security and privacy. In contrast to logical access controls that are implemented within the system, physical access controls are addressed by the controls in the Physical and Environmental Protection ( [PE](#pe) ) family.

### AC-4: Information Flow Enforcement

Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between connected systems based on information flow control policies within the system and between connected systems are defined;.

Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a system and between systems (in contrast to who is allowed to access the information) and without regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include blocking external traffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an agreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see [CA-3](#ca-3) ). Transferring information between systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes prohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only), verifying write permissions before accepting information from another security or privacy domain or connected system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security or privacy attributes and labels.

Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations within systems and between connected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based on message content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and/or inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 32 primarily address cross-domain solution needs that focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, such as high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf products. Information flow enforcement also applies to control plane traffic (e.g., routing and DNS).

### AC-5: Separation of Duties

Identify and document duties of individuals requiring separation are defined; ; and

Define system access authorizations to support separation of duties.

Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes dividing mission or business functions and support functions among different individuals or roles, conducting system support functions with different individuals, and ensuring that security personnel who administer access control functions do not also administer audit functions. Because separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations consider the entirety of systems and system components when developing policy on separation of duties. Separation of duties is enforced through the account management activities in [AC-2](#ac-2) , access control mechanisms in [AC-3](#ac-3) , and identity management activities in [IA-2](#ia-2), [IA-4](#ia-4) , and [IA-12](#ia-12).

### AC-6: Least Privilege

Employ the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) that are necessary to accomplish assigned organizational tasks.

Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and systems. The principle of least privilege is also applied to system processes, ensuring that the processes have access to systems and operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish organizational missions or business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and accounts as necessary to achieve least privilege. Organizations apply least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems.

### AC-6 (1): Authorize Access to Security Functions

Authorize access for individuals and roles with authorized access to security functions and security-relevant information are defined; to:

organization-defined security functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware) ; and

 security-relevant information for authorized access is defined;.

Security functions include establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), configuring settings for events to be audited, and establishing intrusion detection parameters. Security-relevant information includes filtering rules for routers or firewalls, configuration parameters for security services, cryptographic key management information, and access control lists. Authorized personnel include security administrators, system administrators, system security officers, system programmers, and other privileged users.

access is authorized for individuals and roles with authorized access to security functions and security-relevant information are defined; to security functions (deployed in hardware) for authorized access are defined;;

access is authorized for individuals and roles with authorized access to security functions and security-relevant information are defined; to security functions (deployed in software) for authorized access are defined;;

### AC-6 (2): Non-privileged Access for Nonsecurity Functions

Require that users of system accounts (or roles) with access to security functions or security-relevant information, the access to which requires users to use non-privileged accounts to access non-security functions, are defined; use non-privileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions.

Requiring the use of non-privileged accounts when accessing nonsecurity functions limits exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations implement access control policies, such as role-based access control, and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for the user and the processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account.

users of system accounts (or roles) with access to security functions or security-relevant information, the access to which requires users to use non-privileged accounts to access non-security functions, are defined; are required to use non-privileged accounts or roles when accessing non-security functions.

### AC-6 (5): Privileged Accounts

Restrict privileged accounts on the system to personnel or roles to which privileged accounts on the system are to be restricted is/are defined;.

Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as system administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day users from accessing privileged information or privileged functions. Organizations may differentiate in the application of restricting privileged accounts between allowed privileges for local accounts and for domain accounts provided that they retain the ability to control system configurations for key parameters and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk.

privileged accounts on the system are restricted to personnel or roles to which privileged accounts on the system are to be restricted is/are defined;.

Review the frequency at which to review the privileges assigned to roles or classes of users is defined; the privileges assigned to roles or classes of users to which privileges are assigned are defined; to validate the need for such privileges; and

Reassign or remove privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational mission and business needs.

The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time to reflect changes in organizational mission and business functions, environments of operation, technologies, or threats. A periodic review of assigned user privileges is necessary to determine if the rationale for assigning such privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be revalidated, organizations take appropriate corrective actions.

privileges assigned to roles or classes of users to which privileges are assigned are defined; are reviewed the frequency at which to review the privileges assigned to roles or classes of users is defined; to validate the need for such privileges;

### AC-6 (9): Log Use of Privileged Functions

Log the execution of privileged functions.

The misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Logging and analyzing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and, in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat.

### AC-6 (10): Prohibit Non-privileged Users from Executing Privileged Functions

Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions.

Privileged functions include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security or privacy controls, establishing system accounts, performing system integrity checks, and administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals who do not possess appropriate authorizations. Privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users include circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms. Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions is enforced by [AC-3](#ac-3).

non-privileged users are prevented from executing privileged functions.

### AC-7: Unsuccessful Logon Attempts

Enforce a limit of the number of consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user allowed during a time period is defined; consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during a the time period to which the number of consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user is limited is defined; ; and

Automatically lock the account or node for time period for an account or node to be locked is defined (if selected); , lock the account or node until released by an administrator, delay next logon prompt per delay algorithm for the next logon prompt is defined (if selected); , notify system administrator, and/or take other other action to be taken when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded is defined (if selected); when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.

The need to limit unsuccessful logon attempts and take subsequent action when the maximum number of attempts is exceeded applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or network connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined, organization-defined time period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ different algorithms for different components of the system based on the capabilities of those components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating system and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the number of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to answer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode with limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying user profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC) address. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in support of the availability objective, organizations consider a combination of other actions to help prevent brute force attacks. In addition to the above, organizations can prompt users to respond to a secret question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon attempts is exceeded. Automatically unlocking an account after a specified period of time is generally not permitted. However, exceptions may be required based on operational mission or need.

a limit of the number of consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user allowed during a time period is defined; consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during the time period to which the number of consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user is limited is defined; is enforced;

automatically lock the account or node for time period for an account or node to be locked is defined (if selected); , lock the account or node until released by an administrator, delay next logon prompt per delay algorithm for the next logon prompt is defined (if selected); , notify system administrator, and/or take other other action to be taken when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded is defined (if selected); when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.

### AC-8: System Use Notification

Display system use notification message or banner to be displayed by the system to users before granting access to the system is defined; to users before granting access to the system that provides privacy and security notices consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines and state that:

Users are accessing a U.S. Government system;

System usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit;

Unauthorized use of the system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and

Use of the system indicates consent to monitoring and recording;

Retain the notification message or banner on the screen until users acknowledge the usage conditions and take explicit actions to log on to or further access the system; and

For publicly accessible systems:

Display system use information conditions for system use to be displayed by the system before granting further access are defined; , before granting further access to the publicly accessible system;

Display references, if any, to monitoring, recording, or auditing that are consistent with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally prohibit those activities; and

Include a description of the authorized uses of the system.

System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners displayed before individuals log in to systems. System use notifications are used only for access via logon interfaces with human users. Notifications are not required when human interfaces do not exist. Based on an assessment of risk, organizations consider whether or not a secondary system use notification is needed to access applications or other system resources after the initial network logon. Organizations consider system use notification messages or banners displayed in multiple languages based on organizational needs and the demographics of system users. Organizations consult with the privacy office for input regarding privacy messaging and the Office of the General Counsel or organizational equivalent for legal review and approval of warning banner content.

system use notification message or banner to be displayed by the system to users before granting access to the system is defined; is displayed to users before granting access to the system that provides privacy and security notices consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines;

the system use notification states that users are accessing a U.S. Government system;

### AC-11: Device Lock

Prevent further access to the system by initiating a device lock after time period of inactivity after which a device lock is initiated is defined (if selected); of inactivityand/orrequiring the user to initiate a device lock before leaving the system unattended ; and

Retain the device lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification and authentication procedures.

Device locks are temporary actions taken to prevent logical access to organizational systems when users stop work and move away from the immediate vicinity of those systems but do not want to log out because of the temporary nature of their absences. Device locks can be implemented at the operating system level or at the application level. A proximity lock may be used to initiate the device lock (e.g., via a Bluetooth-enabled device or dongle). User-initiated device locking is behavior or policy-based and, as such, requires users to take physical action to initiate the device lock. Device locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of systems, such as when organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays.

further access to the system is prevented by initiating a device lock after time period of inactivity after which a device lock is initiated is defined (if selected); of inactivityand/orrequiring the user to initiate a device lock before leaving the system unattended;

### AC-12: Session Termination

Automatically terminate a user session after conditions or trigger events requiring session disconnect are defined;.

Session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions (in contrast to [SC-10](#sc-10) , which addresses the termination of network connections associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect)). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational system. Such user sessions can be terminated without terminating network sessions. Session termination ends all processes associated with a user’s logical session except for those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events that require automatic termination of the session include organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, or time-of-day restrictions on system use.

### AC-14: Permitted Actions Without Identification or Authentication

Identify user actions that can be performed on the system without identification or authentication are defined; that can be performed on the system without identification or authentication consistent with organizational mission and business functions; and

Document and provide supporting rationale in the security plan for the system, user actions not requiring identification or authentication.

Specific user actions may be permitted without identification or authentication if organizations determine that identification and authentication are not required for the specified user actions. Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or authentication, including when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. Organizations identify actions that normally require identification or authentication but may, under certain circumstances, allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored use. Permitting actions without identification or authentication does not apply to situations where identification and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated but rather to situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on organizational systems without identification and authentication, and therefore, the value for the assignment operation can be "none." 

user actions that can be performed on the system without identification or authentication are defined; that can be performed on the system without identification or authentication consistent with organizational mission and business functions are identified;

user actions not requiring identification or authentication are documented in the security plan for the system;

a rationale for user actions not requiring identification or authentication is provided in the security plan for the system.

### AC-17: Remote Access

Establish and document usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and

Authorize each type of remote access to the system prior to allowing such connections.

Remote access is access to organizational systems (or processes acting on behalf of users) that communicate through external networks such as the Internet. Types of remote access include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect the ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public access. Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations may use information exchange and system connection security agreements to manage remote access connections to other systems, such agreements are addressed as part of [CA-3](#ca-3) . Enforcing access restrictions for remote access is addressed via [AC-3](#ac-3).

usage restrictions are established and documented for each type of remote access allowed;

configuration/connection requirements are established and documented for each type of remote access allowed;

### AC-17 (1): Monitoring and Control

Employ automated mechanisms to monitor and control remote access methods.

Monitoring and control of remote access methods allows organizations to detect attacks and help ensure compliance with remote access policies by auditing the connection activities of remote users on a variety of system components, including servers, notebook computers, workstations, smart phones, and tablets. Audit logging for remote access is enforced by [AU-2](#au-2) . Audit events are defined in [AU-2a](#au-2_smt.a).

Authorize the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access only in a format that provides assessable evidence and for the following needs: organization-defined needs ; and

Document the rationale for remote access in the security plan for the system.

Remote access to systems represents a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. As such, restricting the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access reduces the exposure of the organization and the susceptibility to threats by adversaries to the remote access capability.

### AC-19: Access Control for Mobile Devices

Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices, to include when such devices are outside of controlled areas; and

Authorize the connection of mobile devices to organizational systems.

A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.

Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.

Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to its network and impose a set of usage restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system. Adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements specified in [AC-19](#ac-19) . Many safeguards for mobile devices are reflected in other controls. [AC-20](#ac-20) addresses mobile devices that are not organization-controlled.

configuration requirements are established for organization-controlled mobile devices, including when such devices are outside of the controlled area;

connection requirements are established for organization-controlled mobile devices, including when such devices are outside of the controlled area;

### AC-20: Use of External Systems

establish terms and conditions consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems are defined (if selected); and/oridentify controls asserted to be implemented on external systems consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems are defined (if selected); , consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems, allowing authorized individuals to:

Access the system from external systems; and

Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external systems; or

Prohibit the use of types of external systems prohibited from use are defined;.

External systems are systems that are used by but not part of organizational systems, and for which the organization has no direct control over the implementation of required controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in commercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations; systems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems also include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and systems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the option to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of external systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned or prohibit the use of personally-owned systems).

For some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing information exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations or components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.

External systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope of [AC-20](#ac-20) . Organizations establish specific terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. At a minimum, terms and conditions address the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from external systems and the highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems. If the terms and conditions with the owners of the external systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems.

establish terms and conditions consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems are defined (if selected); and/oridentify controls asserted to be implemented on external systems consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems are defined (if selected); is/are consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems, allowing authorized individuals to access the system from external systems (if applicable);

### AC-20 (1): Limits on Authorized Use

Permit authorized individuals to use an external system to access the system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information only after:

Verification of the implementation of controls on the external system as specified in the organization’s security and privacy policies and security and privacy plans; or

Retention of approved system connection or processing agreements with the organizational entity hosting the external system.

Limiting authorized use recognizes circumstances where individuals using external systems may need to access organizational systems. Organizations need assurance that the external systems contain the necessary controls so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational systems. Verification that the required controls have been implemented can be achieved by external, independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the confidence level required by organizations.

authorized individuals are permitted to use an external system to access the system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information only after verification of the implementation of controls on the external system as specified in the organization’s security and privacy policies and security and privacy plans (if applicable);

Information sharing applies to information that may be restricted in some manner based on some formal or administrative determination. Examples of such information include, contract-sensitive information, classified information related to special access programs or compartments, privileged information, proprietary information, and personally identifiable information. Security and privacy risk assessments as well as applicable laws, regulations, and policies can provide useful inputs to these determinations. Depending on the circumstances, sharing partners may be defined at the individual, group, or organizational level. Information may be defined by content, type, security category, or special access program or compartment. Access restrictions may include non-disclosure agreements (NDA). Information flow techniques and security attributes may be used to provide automated assistance to users making sharing and collaboration decisions.

In accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines, the public is not authorized to have access to nonpublic information, including information protected under the [PRIVACT](#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455) and proprietary information. Publicly accessible content addresses systems that are controlled by the organization and accessible to the public, typically without identification or authentication. Posting information on non-organizational systems (e.g., non-organizational public websites, forums, and social media) is covered by organizational policy. While organizations may have individuals who are responsible for developing and implementing policies about the information that can be made publicly accessible, publicly accessible content addresses the management of the individuals who make such information publicly accessible.
