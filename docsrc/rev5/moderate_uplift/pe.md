## Controls

### PE-4: Access Control for Transmission

Control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines requiring physical access controls are defined; within organizational facilities using security controls to be implemented to control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines within the organizational facility are defined;.

Security controls applied to system distribution and transmission lines prevent accidental damage, disruption, and physical tampering. Such controls may also be necessary to prevent eavesdropping or modification of unencrypted transmissions. Security controls used to control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines include disconnected or locked spare jacks, locked wiring closets, protection of cabling by conduit or cable trays, and wiretapping sensors.

physical access to system distribution and transmission lines requiring physical access controls are defined; within organizational facilities is controlled using security controls to be implemented to control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines within the organizational facility are defined;.

### PE-6 (1): Intrusion Alarms and Surveillance Equipment

Monitor physical access to the facility where the system resides using physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment.

Physical intrusion alarms can be employed to alert security personnel when unauthorized access to the facility is attempted. Alarm systems work in conjunction with physical barriers, physical access control systems, and security guards by triggering a response when these other forms of security have been compromised or breached. Physical intrusion alarms can include different types of sensor devices, such as motion sensors, contact sensors, and broken glass sensors. Surveillance equipment includes video cameras installed at strategic locations throughout the facility.

### PE-9: Power Equipment and Cabling

Protect power equipment and power cabling for the system from damage and destruction.

Organizations determine the types of protection necessary for the power equipment and cabling employed at different locations that are both internal and external to organizational facilities and environments of operation. Types of power equipment and cabling include internal cabling and uninterruptable power sources in offices or data centers, generators and power cabling outside of buildings, and power sources for self-contained components such as satellites, vehicles, and other deployable systems.

Place emergency shutoff switches or devices in location of emergency shutoff switches or devices by system or system component is defined; to facilitate access for authorized personnel; and

Protect emergency power shutoff capability from unauthorized activation.

Emergency power shutoff primarily applies to organizational facilities that contain concentrations of system resources, including data centers, mainframe computer rooms, server rooms, and areas with computer-controlled machinery.

the capability to shut off power to system or individual system components that require the capability to shut off power in emergency situations is/are defined; in emergency situations is provided;

emergency shutoff switches or devices are placed in location of emergency shutoff switches or devices by system or system component is defined; to facilitate access for authorized personnel;

the emergency power shutoff capability is protected from unauthorized activation.

### PE-11: Emergency Power

Provide an uninterruptible power supply to facilitate an orderly shutdown of the systemortransition of the system to long-term alternate power in the event of a primary power source loss.

An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is an electrical system or mechanism that provides emergency power when there is a failure of the main power source. A UPS is typically used to protect computers, data centers, telecommunication equipment, or other electrical equipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious mission or business disruption, or loss of data or information. A UPS differs from an emergency power system or backup generator in that the UPS provides near-instantaneous protection from unanticipated power interruptions from the main power source by providing energy stored in batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The battery duration of a UPS is relatively short but provides sufficient time to start a standby power source, such as a backup generator, or properly shut down the system.

an uninterruptible power supply is provided to facilitate an orderly shutdown of the systemortransition of the system to long-term alternate power in the event of a primary power source loss.

### PE-13 (1): Detection Systems — Automatic Activation and Notification

Employ fire detection systems that activate automatically and notify personnel or roles to be notified in the event of a fire is/are defined; and emergency responders to be notified in the event of a fire are defined; in the event of a fire.

Organizations can identify personnel, roles, and emergency responders if individuals on the notification list need to have access authorizations or clearances (e.g., to enter to facilities where access is restricted due to the classification or impact level of information within the facility). Notification mechanisms may require independent energy sources to ensure that the notification capability is not adversely affected by the fire.
