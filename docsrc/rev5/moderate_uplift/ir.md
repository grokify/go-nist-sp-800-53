## Controls

### IR-3: Incident Response Testing

Test the effectiveness of the incident response capability for the system {{ insert: param, ir-03_odp.01 }} using the following tests: {{ insert: param, ir-03_odp.02 }}.

Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine their effectiveness and identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing includes the use of checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, and simulations (parallel or full interrupt). Incident response testing can include a determination of the effects on organizational operations and assets and individuals due to incident response. The use of qualitative and quantitative data aids in determining the effectiveness of incident response processes.

the effectiveness of the incident response capability for the system is tested {{ insert: param, ir-03_odp.01 }} using {{ insert: param, ir-03_odp.02 }}.

### IR-6 (3): Supply Chain Coordination

Provide incident information to the provider of the product or service and other organizations involved in the supply chain or supply chain governance for systems or system components related to the incident.

Organizations involved in supply chain activities include product developers, system integrators, manufacturers, packagers, assemblers, distributors, vendors, and resellers. Entities that provide supply chain governance include the Federal Acquisition Security Council (FASC). Supply chain incidents include compromises or breaches that involve information technology products, system components, development processes or personnel, distribution processes, or warehousing facilities. Organizations determine the appropriate information to share and consider the value gained from informing external organizations about supply chain incidents, including the ability to improve processes or to identify the root cause of an incident.

incident information is provided to the provider of the product or service and other organizations involved in the supply chain or supply chain governance for systems or system components related to the incident.

### IR-7 (1): Automation Support for Availability of Information and Support

Increase the availability of incident response information and support using {{ insert: param, ir-07.01_odp }}.

Automated mechanisms can provide a push or pull capability for users to obtain incident response assistance. For example, individuals may have access to a website to query the assistance capability, or the assistance capability can proactively send incident response information to users (general distribution or targeted) as part of increasing understanding of current response capabilities and support.

the availability of incident response information and support is increased using {{ insert: param, ir-07.01_odp }}.
